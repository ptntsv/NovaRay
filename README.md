NovaRay is a raytracer that produces an image and supports following core features:
- primitive shapes (e.g spheres, cubes, triangles)
- camera (defining viewpoint, image resolution, field of view)
- diffuse lighting, shadows
- simple materials (matte, metal surfaces)
- anti-aliasing
and more advances features:
- textures
- motion blur
- perlin noise
- bounding volume hierarchy
- quadrilaterals
- multithreading (probably)
- some optimizations
